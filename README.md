# Getting Started with Pagination React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). `Bootstrap` technology version 5.1 is used for the general design. Of course, some parts of the design had to be crushed. This was taken care of with `sass`. Using the useState Hook, `dummy data` in the utils folder is processed.

### `yarn start`
